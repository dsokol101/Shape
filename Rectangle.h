/* How do we use inheritance in C++ ? 
 
Some questions:
1. Can the derived class access the private members of the base class?
NO. Same as in Java, you have access to the public and protected members

2. How do I call a public member function in the derived class?
simply call as if it is an instance function of the derived class

3. How do I initialize the things that I inherited from the base class?
idea: before you enter your own constructor, the base class constructor
should be called and everything that you inherited is initialized.

This is done with an explicit constructor call in the member initialization list
